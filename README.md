# GolfBallComputerVision

## Overview

This repository houses a golf ball detection algorithm that leverages the power of computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately predict the location of a golf ball in each frame of a video. This computer vision model builds upon YOLOv8's pretrained model, incorporating adjusted weights to fine-tune detection capabilities targetted towards golf ball tracking. Designed for golf enthusiasts seeking analytics to perfect their craft, this project combines the latest in deep learning technologies to offer precise ball tracking capabilities.
